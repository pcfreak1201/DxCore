| Configurable Custom Logic library                                     |
| Developed in 2019 by MCUdude. https://github.com/MCUdude/             |
| Ported to DxC and maintained for mTC and DxC by Sprence Konde         |
| Example by Spence Konde                                               |
|                                                                       |
| LatchNoSeq.ino - Getting "RS Latch" like behavior with a single even  |
| numbered LUT - or with an odd LUT and an event channel                |
|                                                                       |
| In this example we use the configurable logic peripherals in AVR      |
| to act as a "latch" WITHOUT using both LUTs and the sequencer         |
| For the even-numbered logic block(s) we can simply use the feedback   |
| input. Otherwise we need to use the event system.                     |
| Because we can use the output of the LUT, what we want is a truth     |
| table that will maintain a HIGH or LOW if no buttons are prssed. We   |
| also need to make sure that it handles the "both buttons pressed"     |
| case gracefully; three of the 4 options work:
| * Maintain current state if both buttons are depressed. This means    |
|   while both buttons are pressed, the output will be as dictated by
|   the first button pressed, and when one button is released, if the   |
|   other button would flip it, it will. This was used here, partly     |
|   because the truth table ends up the same whether the inputs are     |
|   active high or low                                                  |
| * Set the output LOW whenever both inputs are asserted.               |
|   Assuming active low inputs, this corresponds to truth = 0x8C        |
| * Set the output HIGH whenever both inputs are asserted               |
|   Assuming active low inputs, this corresponds to truth = 0x8F        |
| * ~Set the output to the opposite state when both inputs asserted~     |
|   This does not produce something that acts like a latch. It will     |
|   oscillate at a very high frequency when both inputs are on, as it    |
|   will be switching between two state, each of which tell it to       |
|   switch again. This would correspond to 0x8D in the truth table; so  |
|   avoid that one.
|                                           3-input     truth table:    |
| We use CCL LUT event as our "feedback",   |PA2|PA1|CCL| Y |           |
| PA1 is RESET and PA2 is SET, both         |---|---|---|---|           |
| active low                                | 0 | 0 | 0 | 0 |           |
| Connect a button between those and Gnd    | 0 | 0 | 1 | 1 |           |
| Pressing button on PA2 will set output    | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |           |
| HIGH and pressing button on PA1 will set  | 0 | 1 | 1 | 1 |           |
| output LOW, and pressing neither will do  | 1 | 0 | 0 | 0 |           |
| nothing.                                  | 1 | 0 | 1 | 0 |           |
| We could even then fire an interrupt from | 1 | 1 | 0 | 0 |           |
| that pin                                  | 1 | 1 | 1 | 1 |           |
|                                                                       |
| The sky (well, and the number of LUTs) is the limit!!                 |
|                                                                       |
| Warning:                                                              |
| The same library is used for mTC and DxC; this example is used on both|
| As it is used in our compile testing, it needs to compile on both the |
| tinyAVRs and the Dx and Ex series. As a consequence, because this     |
| involves EVSYS, which is very different on tiny0/1 vs everything else |
| a number of #ifdef statements are used to select the right            |
| implementation.                                                       |
