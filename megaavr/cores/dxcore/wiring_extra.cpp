      chan is one of:
      0  (channel 0)
      1  (channel 1)
      -1 (whichever is unused)

      This may return:
      0  (channel 0 was set)
      1  (channel 1 was set)
      PERIPHERAL_IN_USE (you asked for an unused channel, but they are both in use already generating different frequencies)
      CHANNEL0_UNCHANGED (nothing was set - you asked for an unused channel, but channel 0 is already set to the specified value)
      CHANNEL1_UNCHANGED (nothing was set - you asked for an unused channel, but channel 1 is already set to the specified value)
      NOT_A_CHANNEL (nothing was set - a channel number that isn't a channel was specified)

      Intended usage:
      int8_t temp = _setRTCEventChan(myvalue, -1);
      if (temp < 0) {
        // handle error
      } else {
        mychannel = temp;
      }

      Then when using the channel, bitwise AND it with 0x01, so you get 0 or 1 from a CHANNEL0_UNCHANGED or CHANNEL1_UNCHANGED.
      volatile uint8_t* mygenerator = &EVSYS_CHANNEL0; // in practice you'd be hopefully calling something to find a free generator...

      *mygenerator = ((mychannel & 0x01) ? EVSYS_PITEV1 : EVSYS_PITEV0);

      Later, when done with the RTC channel, you can release it with:

      _setRTCEventChan(0, mychannel);

      This will leave it unchanged if it returned CHANNEL0_UNCHANGED or CHANNEL1_UNCHANGED because in that case something else was already using the RTC for something
      and you were just piggybacking on that, so you wouldn't want to trash that.
      Note that this scheme only works if the first thing using the timer event channels doesn't stop the channel befopre
